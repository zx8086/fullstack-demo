This is an adder for `svelte-add`; you should [read its `README`](https://github.com/svelte-add/svelte-add#readme) before continuing here.

## ➕ Adding SASS

This adder's codename is `sass`, and can be used like so:

```sh
npx svelte-add@latest sass
```

### 🏞 Supported environments

This adder supports SvelteKit and Vite-powered Svelte apps (all the environments `svelte-add` currently supports).

### ⚙️ Options

This adder doesn't take any options of its own.

## 🛠 Using SASS

This adder supports _pretty much_ all of [svelte-add/sass](https://github.com/svelte-add/scss) features, but instead of using `scss/.scss` you'd use `sass/.sass`
